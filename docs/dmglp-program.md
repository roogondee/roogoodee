# DMGLP — W Medical Diabetes & Metabolic Care (GLP-1) program

Lives at **roogondee.com/dmglp**. Built from the owner's spec (CLAUDE.md of
the "W Medical Diabetes & Metabolic Care System"), adapted to this repo:
same Next.js app, same Supabase project, same admin login.

| Surface | URL | Who |
|---|---|---|
| Ad landing (public) | `/dmglp` | patients / ad clicks |
| Patient LIFF | `/dmglp/liff?page=appointments\|survey\|program` | patients, inside LINE |
| Staff system | `/dmglp/staff/...` | hospital staff (admin login + program role) |
| Google Ads offline feed | `/api/dmglp/conversions-export` | Ads scheduled upload |
| Controlled-drug CSV | `/api/dmglp/pharmacy-export` | pharmacist |
| Daily cron | `/api/cron/dmglp-daily` (09:00 BKK) | Vercel |

## Hard boundaries (from the spec — never relax)

1. **No online drug sales.** No cart, checkout, or ordering anywhere.
2. **The system never recommends a dose.** `src/lib/dmglp/titration.ts` only
   raises flags (`DOSE_INCREASE_TOO_EARLY`, `SKIPPED_STEP`, `LONG_GAP`) on the
   dose the doctor chose; the doctor must tick "รับทราบคำเตือน" to save it.
3. **No drug brand names, strengths or drug prices on `/dmglp`** (public) —
   the landing copy names only the drug *class* once, in a FAQ. Brand names
   and prices exist only in staff screens and 1:1 LINE by staff.
4. **Health data never reaches an ad platform.** The Ads feed is exactly five
   columns (gclid, name, time, value, currency) — `tests/dmglp/conversions.test.mts`.
   Client events `dmglp_line_click` / `dmglp_call_click` carry no health data.
5. **LINE messages to patients are neutral** — `src/lib/dmglp/reminders-text.ts`
   has a forbidden-word list (drug names, mg, HbA1c, เบาหวาน, ...) and a test.
6. **Not an EMR.** Patients link to HIS by `hn`; `dmglp_patients` holds only
   what the program needs.

## Setup

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/create_dmglp_program.sql` **before deploying**
   (adds `admin_users.dmglp_role`, 28 `dmglp_*` tables, seed prices/tiers/rules).
   `supabase/seed/dmglp_sample_patients.sql` is dev-only.
2. Assign program roles: a site **manager** opens `/dmglp/staff/settings/staff`
   and sets each admin user's role (แพทย์ / เภสัชกร / พยาบาล / แอดมิน /
   การเงิน / การตลาด / ผู้จัดการ / ผู้ตรวจสอบ) plus **license number** for
   doctors and pharmacists — dispensing is blocked without both.
3. Env (all optional, degrade gracefully):
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFF_DMGLP_ID` — LIFF app whose endpoint is
     `https://roogondee.com/dmglp/liff` (LINE Login channel, size Tall). Without
     it, reminders go out without a link and surveys are skipped.
   - `LINE_LOGIN_CHANNEL_ID` — already used by the quiz; verifies the id_token.
   - `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` — pushes reminders (already set).
   - `LINE_NOTIFY_GROUP_ID` — high-severity alerts + DMGLP LINE leads.
   - `ADS_OFFLINE_EXPORT_USER/PASSWORD` — Basic auth for the Ads scheduled upload.
   - `CRON_SECRET` — cron auth (already set).
   - `PHARMACY_API_URL` + `PHARMACY_API_KEY` — HN lookup in the W Medical
     pharmacy (see "HN" below). URL = the pharmacy backend
     (`https://wmedical-pharmacy-production.up.railway.app`); the key is created
     by a pharmacy admin in the pharmacy app's API-key settings with permission
     `patients:lookup`. Without them the button says "ยังไม่ได้เชื่อมระบบห้องยา"
     and staff type the HN by hand.
4. Google Ads: create three "Import → Clicks" conversion actions named
   `DMGLP LINE Contact`, `DMGLP Booked`, `DMGLP Treatment Started` and point a
   scheduled HTTPS upload at `/api/dmglp/conversions-export`. Landing Final URL:
   `https://roogondee.com/dmglp` (gclid auto-tagging on).
5. Partners: create at `/dmglp/staff/partners`; their link is
   `roogondee.com/dmglp?ref=<REF_CODE>`.

## Roles (§3)

Permission matrix: `src/lib/dmglp/roles.ts` (`MATRIX`). Highlights:
admin sees leads/booking/registration/tasks but no clinical data; nurse
screens and enters vitals/labs; doctor confirms indication, decides doses,
prescribes; pharmacist dispenses, ledger, fridge, alerts; finance sells
programs, payments, refunds, partner statements; marketing sees attribution
and aggregated dashboards only; manager read-only; auditor reads the audit
log. Every clinical read/write goes to `dmglp_audit_log`.

## Patient journey in the staff UI

1. **Lead** arrives (LINE with `DM-xxxx`, walk-in, phone) → `/dmglp/staff/leads`.
2. **Register** patient (HN — typed, or picked via "ค้นหา HN จากระบบห้องยา";
   PDPA consent required) → `/dmglp/staff/patients`.
3. **Screen** (nurse/doctor) → eligibility `eligible | needs_review | ineligible`
   from `dmglp_eligibility_rules` (BMI ≥ 30, ≥ 27 + comorbidity, or T2DM;
   pregnancy/MTC/MEN2 block; cautions warn).
4. **Enroll** (doctor): drug + ICD-10 + start date → 9 appointments
   (D0, D3, D7, W4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24) generated automatically.
5. **Visit**: check-in from `/dmglp/staff/today` → vitals, side effects,
   labs, checklist → doctor's dose decision (flags shown) → prescription
   (qty 1) → close visit (consumes program entitlements).
6. **Dispense** (pharmacist): FEFO pen pick, counseling checklist; blocked
   without prescription, doctor licence, HN, confirmed indication, eligibility,
   pen in stock and not expired. First dispense = `treatment_started`.
7. **Follow-up**: cron sends D-1 reminders and D-2 survey links; D3/D7 are
   pharmacist LINE follow-ups (one tap on the today screen); red-flag survey
   answers create a high alert + LINE group ping; no-show → `missed`, after
   7 days → `call_no_show` task (exactly one per appointment).
8. **Programs** (finance): BASIC/PLUS/PREMIUM, upfront or 0% × 6, 8-month
   validity; refund = paid − Σ(list price × used), floored at 0.

## HN — the link to HIS

The program is not an EMR: `dmglp_patients.hn` is its only link to the
hospital record. Next to the HN field on the register form and on the
patient's edit card, **ค้นหา HN จากระบบห้องยา** sends the phone on that form
(edit card: the stored phone when the field is empty) to the W Medical
pharmacy — server action `lookupPharmacyHn` (permission `patients.write`:
admin, nurse, doctor) → `src/lib/integrations/pharmacy.ts`. Up to 10 matches
come back with the name, **HN โรงพยาบาล** (`original_hn`, the HIS HN when the
pharmacy record was imported from HIS) and **รหัสห้องยา** (the pharmacy's own
id). Picking one fills the input with the HIS HN, else the pharmacy id.
Nothing is saved until staff submit the form, and only the HN is stored —
never the name. Each lookup is a `lookup` row in `dmglp_audit_log` with counts
only (phones sent, matches, outcome). A patient the pharmacy doesn't know
still needs the HN typed by hand. Contract: `docs/system-integration.md`.

## Tests

`npm test` runs `node --test tests/**/*.test.mts` (Node ≥ 22.18, no build):
schedule generation, titration flags, eligibility, refund/instalments,
Ads CSV shape, ref-code parsing, LINE text forbidden words — plus the pharmacy
HN lookup contract (`tests/integrations/pharmacy.test.mts`).

## Open items to confirm with the hospital

- Real lab/CGM/TANITA/dietitian prices (rows marked `*` in `/dmglp/staff/settings/prices`)
- Specialist doctor fee contract
- Thai package-insert indications for current lots (adjust `/dmglp/staff/settings/rules`)
- Partner fee basis after legal review (`shared_care_fee`)
- LINE OA message quota for reminders
- HIS integration: the HN is looked up by phone in the pharmacy (see "HN"
  above). A patient the pharmacy doesn't know still needs the HN typed by hand,
  and for a pharmacy record that was not imported from HIS the lookup fills the
  pharmacy id (รหัสห้องยา), not an HIS HN — a direct HIS lookup is still open
- Track & Trace CSV column list (`src/app/api/dmglp/pharmacy-export/route.ts` `HEADER`)
